        <h1>Asked If He Doctored Baseballs, Yankees Star Stumbles Through Answer</h1>

        <p>
            “I don’t know quite how to answer that,” Gerrit Cole said when asked 
            if he uses a sticky paste called Spider Tack to increase his spin rate.

        <p>
            Asked directly on Tuesday if he had used Spider Tack — a sticky paste that 
            can greatly increase the spin on pitches — while on the mound, the Yankees’ 
            Gerrit Cole stammered through an answer by citing the shadowy tradition of 
            pitchers breaking rules to get an edge.
        </p>
            “I don’t know quite how to answer that, to be honest,” Cole said on a Zoom 
            conference with reporters, after searching roughly 15 seconds for an answer. 
            “I mean, there are customs and practices that have been passed down from older 
            players to younger players from the last generation of players to this generation 
            of players. I think there are some things that are certainly out of bounds in 
            that regard, and I’ve stood pretty firm in terms of that, in terms of the 
            communication between our peers and whatnot.”
